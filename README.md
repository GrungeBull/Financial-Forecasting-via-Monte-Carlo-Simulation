# Financial-Forecasting-via-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

Monte Carlo simulations for forecasting investing portfolios over 20 &amp; 25 years, considering varied salary and portfolio growth rates, providing insights and probabilities into future financial outcomes.

## Purpose of the Project

This project leverages the Monte Carlo Simulation to explore potential financial scenarios, particularly focusing on understanding and planning investment strategies over a fixed period. It provides a probabilistic approach to forecasting future portfolio values, considering various factors like salary growth, portfolio growth, and consistent investments.

## Setup

* **Variables:** Primarily focuses on the portfolio and salary growth rates, along with the annual investment rate.
* **Timeframe:** Analyses are conducted over two distinct timeframes: 20 and 25 years.
* **Iterations:** Each scenario is simulated 1000 times to generate a distribution of possible outcomes.

## Interpretation

* The results offer a distribution of potential future portfolio values.
* Probabilities of achieving specific financial milestones (e.g., a portfolio value of $1,000,000) are calculated and analyzed.
* Analyze the histograms to visualize the most probable outcomes and understand the risk and reward trade-offs.

## Assumptions and Variations in the Adjusted Model

### Initial Model
* **Salary Growth:** Assumed to be linear and consistent.
* **Portfolio Growth:** Perceived to occur at a constant rate.

### Adjusted Model for 20 and 25 Years
* **Salary Growth Rate:** Modeled using a uniform distribution between 0% and 5%.
* **Portfolio Growth Rate:** Modeled using a normal distribution with a mean of 10% and a standard deviation of 5%.
* Simulations are utilized to incorporate randomness and yield a range of possible outcomes, providing insights into the probabilities of achieving desired financial goals.

## Using the Excel Tool

### Inputs 

* **Age:** Your current age.
* **Current Salary:** Your present annual salary.
* **Current Portfolio:** Your existing investment portfolio value.

### Adjustments/Users Guide

* Modify the constants (e.g., salary, age) as per your scenario.
* Adjust the distributions used for salary and portfolio growth rates to align with your expectations or scenarios you wish to explore.
* Utilize the histograms and descriptive statistics to comprehend the potential scenarios and associated probabilities.
